Then\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport \"github.com/dontpanic92/wxGo/wx\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have fun!\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n----\r\n\r\nExamples are in `examples` folder. `Dapeton` is a simple notepad, and `controls` is a dialog that contains several widgets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe size of the final executalble program grows larger as more classes added into wxGo. Both examples are ~50MB large. You can use `strip` command to reduce the size, but it will remove the symbols.\r\n",
